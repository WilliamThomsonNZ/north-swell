# North Swell

[View Live Demo](north-swell.netlify.app)

North swell is an app to save surf spots and have access to the forecast for each surf spot in real time

# Motivation

The motivation for creating this app was to have quick access to the forecast of some of my local surf beaches all in one place. Being able to quickly view what the swell and wind is doing at my local spots with out having to view them one by one has saved a lot of time.

# Technology Used

North swell is built on React and TailwindCSS. The API used for weather data is Storm Glass.
